# FCI-database-development-documentation
I currently hold a Database Development Technologist role at Five Colleges Incorporation. (Part-time CPT). This is the phase 1 of the project and major work is in mySQL. 
This repository is made to create a record of my documentation. (Proof of work I do)
The project is to create a system to store details of 250+ members of the Learning in Retirement department. Main catch is that the system should be easy to update, maintain and handle by non-technical office manager. 
Currently all their records are maunal on paper.
